This repo demonstrates and partially summarizes some of the (serious) work that I had completed during my wonderful undergrad RA research time (under the supervision of Professors Mao Ye and Jialan Wang and collaboration with their PhD students). Some big component of my work is very exciting, but I am unable to share due to the obligations or the nature of NDAs. 
- ETF rebalancing, TAQ data and Supercomputing PSC Bridges2
- Firm share repurchase, the LDB dataset, and the many great resources from Prof. Terrence Odean
- Some webscraping techinical to collect data and more generally meet research needs
- Some miscellaneous things
